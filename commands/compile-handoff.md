description: Compile supplied planning decisions into a bounded handoff contract proposal.
---

Compile `$ARGUMENTS` into a `handoff-contract/v1` proposal using the handoff-compiler skill. Require caller-supplied task class, units, ownership or read-only evidence, dependencies, context references, criteria/oracles, limits, and handback needs. Return only a proposal or stable diagnostics. Preserve policy denial and blocking ambiguity as terminal inputs. Do not write files or alter lifecycle authority.
